\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orga38c260}
\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:orgc2e2695}
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirement specification for the Endless Pinball game and its connected website. The scope of this document is to outline the interactions the user would have with the game, as well as to highlight what needs to be done during the development phase of this project.

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\label{sec:orgc631535}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
\label{sec:org7904af6}
The software outlined in this document will have two sets of user interfaces, one for the website and one for the Endless Pinball game itself. 
\begin{description}
\item[{Endless Pinball:}] The Endless Pinball game will be designed using the \textbf{MVC} architecture design pattern for its UI as we want the controller to handle any interactable scenarios for the user. The controller would handle the events that the user would use to control the pinball, and to select in the pause menu. The view, in our case, would display data such as the score the user currently has and what power-up they have. The Model part would manage all the incoming data and the View would display it.
\item[{Endless Pinball website:}] Our website would use the Client-Server architecture, as it is intended just to display the high scores from the game. The website would receive POST requests from the game, and would have no controller for user interaction. This will allow the user to visit the site, and the site will update the view and display it to the user when a new high score is received.
\end{description}
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\label{sec:org1316e46}
The game will interact with the phones vibration motors to make the game more interactive, and could also interact with the phones gyro sensor to control the pinball. The game will also interact with the phones internal GPU in order to render the game. 
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\label{sec:org800a726}
\subsection{Communications Interfaces}
\label{sec:orgddde17a}
The game will use GET requests in the form of JSON to the game application,
and the game application will use POST to post user uploaded pictures and the high score from the user. Communication is done between the website
and the Endless Browser game application, allowing users to upload their high score. 
\section{System Features}
\label{sec:org4af94b1}
<This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system
features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by
use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of
these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.>
